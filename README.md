# Osprey Migration Tracking

## Introduction

This project presents the basic methodology and results obtained for an osprey data set chosen from Movebank for predicting the migration periodicity and directionality exhibited by these birds as a group and individually. K-means clustering and the Discrete Fourier Transform were used to predict the migration patterns. Long Short-Term Memory was used to predict the future movement of the birds.

## Details

The codes for each of LSTM, K-Means and DFT/FFT is provided. Since the input data is huge, not all the data has been uploaded. (Contact me if required). The codes are a mix of iPython notebook and traditional python files.
